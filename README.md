# Fake-Instagram-Profile-Detector
A machine learning solution to detect fake Instagram profiles using metadata analysis. Built with Python/Keras, it provides detailed reports and is scalable. Welcome to contributions for future enhancements.

This is a project that aims to detect fake Instagram profiles using machine learning. The model uses a dataset of Instagram profiles that have been manually labeled as either "real" or "fake" to learn patterns and features that can distinguish between the two types of profiles.

The detector takes a username as input and analyzes the profile's metadata, images, and captions to determine whether it is likely to be a fake profile. The output is a probability score indicating the likelihood that the profile is fake.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of Instagram profiles that have been manually labeled as either "real" or "fake". The profiles were collected from various sources and were labeled by human annotators based on several criteria, including profile completeness, posting frequency, and engagement metrics.

Model
The model is built using Python and the Keras library, and uses a deep neural network architecture to learn patterns and features in the data. The model achieves a high accuracy rate on the testing dataset and can be easily adapted to detect fake profiles on other social media platforms as well.

Future work
In the future, we plan to improve the detector's accuracy by incorporating additional features and data sources. We also plan to develop a web application that allows users to easily check the authenticity of Instagram profiles.In the future, we plan to add more features to the detector, such as detecting fake followers or likes. We also plan to integrate the detector into a web application, so it can be used by anyone to check if their profile has been targeted by fake accounts.

If you have any feedback or suggestions for improving the detector, please feel free to submit an issue or pull request on the GitHub repository.
